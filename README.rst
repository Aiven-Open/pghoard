``pghoard`` is a PostgreSQL backup daemon and restore tooling for cloud object storages.

Features:

* Automatic periodic basebackups
* Automatic transaction log (WAL/xlog) backups (using either ``pg_receivexlog``
  or ``archive_command``)
* Cloud object storage support (AWS S3, Google Cloud, OpenStack Swift, Azure, Ceph)
* Backup restoration directly from object storage, compressed and encrypted
* Point-in-time-recovery (PITR)
* Initialize a new standby from object storage backups, automatically configured as
  a replicating hot-standby

Fault-resilience and monitoring:

* Persists over temporary object storage connectivity issues by retrying transfers
* Verifies WAL file headers before upload (backup) and after download (restore),
  so that e.g. files recycled by PostgreSQL are ignored
* Automatic history cleanup (backups and related WAL files older than N days)
* ``archive_sync`` tool for detecting holes in WAL backup streams and fixing them
* Keeps statistics updated in a file on disk (for monitoring tools)
* Creates alert files on disk on problems (for monitoring tools)

Performance:

* Parallel compression and encryption
* WAL pre-fetching on restore


Overview
========

PostgreSQL Point In Time Replication (PITR) consists of a having a database
basebackup and changes after that point go into WAL log files that can be
replayed to get to the desired replication point.

``pghoard`` supports multiple operating models. The basic mode where you have a
separate backup machine, ``pghoard`` can simply connect with ``pg_receivexlog`` to
receive WAL files from the database as they're written.  Another model is to
use ``pghoard_postgres_command`` as a PostgreSQL ``archive_command``.

With both modes of operations ``pghoard`` creates basebackups using
pg_basebackup that is run against the database in question.

``pghoard`` compresses the received WAL logs and basebackups with Snappy (default)
or LZMA (level 0) in order to ensure good compression speed and relatively small
backup size. For performance critical applications it is recommended to test
both compression algorithms to find the most suitable trade-off for the
particular use-case (snappy is much faster but yields larger compressed files).

Optionally, ``pghoard`` can encrypt backed up data at rest. Each individual
file is encrypted and authenticated with file specific keys. The file
specific keys are included in the backup in turn encrypted with a master
RSA private/public key pair.

``pghoard`` also supports backing up and restoring from either a local machine
or from various object stores (AWS S3, Azure (experimental), Ceph, Google
Cloud and OpenStack Swift.)

In case you just have a single database machine, it is heavily recommended
to let ``pghoard`` backup the files into an object storage service, so in case
the machine where it's running is incapacitated, there's still access to the
database backups.


Building
========

To build an installation package for your distribution, go to the root
directory of a ``pghoard`` Git checkout and then run:

Debian::

  make deb

This will produce a ``.deb`` package into the parent directory of the Git
checkout.

Fedora::

  make rpm

This will produce a ``.rpm`` package usually into ``rpm/RPMS/noarch/``.

Python/Other::

  python setup.py bdist_egg

This will produce an egg file into a dist directory within the same folder.

``pghoard`` requires Python 3.3 or newer and PostgreSQL 9.3 or newer.


Installation
============

To install it run as root:

Debian::

  dpkg -i ../pghoard*.deb

Fedora::

  dnf install rpm/RPMS/noarch/*

On Fedora it is recommended to simply run ``pghoard`` under ``systemd``::

  systemctl enable pghoard.service

and eventually after the setup section, you can just run::

  systemctl start pghoard.service

Python/Other::

  easy_install dist/pghoard-1.1.0-py3.4.egg

On Debian/Other systems it is recommended that you run ``pghoard`` within a
``supervisord`` (http://supervisord.org) Process control system.  (see examples
directory for an example ``supervisord.conf``)


Setup
=====

After this you need to create a suitable JSON configuration file for your
installation.

0.  Make sure PostgreSQL is configured to allow WAL archival and retrieval.
    ``postgresql.conf`` should have ``wal_level`` set to ``archive`` or
    higher and ``max_wal_senders`` set to a non-zero value, for example::

        wal_level = archive
        max_wal_senders = 4

1. Create a suitable PostgreSQL user account for ``pghoard``::

     CREATE USER pghoard PASSWORD 'putyourpasswordhere' REPLICATION;

2. Edit the local ``pg_hba.conf`` to allow access for the newly created
   account to the ``replication`` database from the master and standby
   nodes. After editing, please reload the configuration with either::

     SELECT pg_reload_conf();

   or by sending directly a ``SIGHUP`` to the PostgreSQL ``postmaster`` process.

3. Fill in the created user account and master/standby addresses into the
   configuration file ``pghoard.json`` to the section ``backup_sites``.

4. Fill in the possible object storage user credentials into the
   configuration file ``pghoard.json`` under section ``object_storage``
   in case you wish ``pghoard`` to back up into the cloud.

5. Now copy the same ``pghoard.json`` configuration to the standby
   node if there are any.

Other possible configuration settings are covered in more detail under the
`Configuration keys`_ section of this README.

6. If all has been set up correctly up to this point, ``pghoard`` should now be
   ready to be started.


Alert files
===========

Alert files are created whenever an error condition that requires human
intervention to solve.  You're recommended to add checks for the existence
of these files to your alerting system.

``authentication_error``

There has been a problem in the authentication of at least one of the
PostgreSQL connections.  This usually denotes a wrong username and/or
password.

``configuration_error``

There has been a problem in the authentication of at least one of the
PostgreSQL connections.  This usually denotes a missing ``pg_hba.conf`` entry or
incompatible settings in postgresql.conf.

``upload_retries_warning``

Upload of a file has failed more times than
``upload_retries_warning_limit``. Needs human intervention to figure
out why and to delete the alert once the situation has been fixed.

``version_mismatch_error``

Your local PostgreSQL client versions of pg_basebackup or ``pg_receivexlog`` do
not match with the servers PostgreSQL version.  You need to update them to
be on the same version level.

``version_unsupported_error``

Server PostgreSQL versions is not supported.


General notes
=============

If correctly installed, ``pghoard`` comes with five executables, ``pghoard``,
``pghoard_archive_sync``, ``pghoard_create_keys`` and
``pghoard_postgres_command`` and ``pghoard_restore``

``pghoard`` is the main process that should be run under ``systemd`` or
``supervisord``.  It handles the backup of the configured sites.

``pghoard_archive_sync`` can be used to see if any local files should
be archived but haven't been. The other usecase it has is to determine
if there are any gaps in the required files in the WAL archive
from the current WAL file on to to the latest basebackup's first WAL file.

``pghoard_create_keys`` can be used to generate and output encryption keys
in the ``pghoard`` configuration format.

``pghoard_restore`` is a command line tool that can be used to restore a
previous database backup from either ``pghoard`` itself or from one of the
supported object stores.  ``pghoard_restore`` can also configure
``recovery.conf`` to use ``pghoard_postgres_command`` as the WAL ``restore_command``
in ``recovery.conf``.

``pghoard_postgres_command`` is a command line tool that can be used as
PostgreSQL's ``archive_command`` or ``recovery_command``.  It communicates with
``pghoard`` 's locally running webserver to let it know there's a new file that
needs to be compressed, encrypted and stored in an object store (in archive
mode) or it's inverse (in restore mode.)

To enable PostgreSQL's archiving with ``pghoard`` you must set up ``pghoard``
properly and enter the following configuration keys in ``postgresql.conf``::

    wal_level = archive
    archive_mode = on
    archive_command = pghoard_postgres_command --mode archive --site yoursite --xlog %f

While ``pghoard`` is running it may be useful to read the JSON state file
``pghoard_state.json`` that exists where ``json_state_file_path`` points.
The JSON state file is human readable and is meant to describe the current
state of ``pghoard`` 's backup activities.


Restoring databases
===================

You can list your database basebackups by running::

  pghoard_restore list-basebackups --config /var/lib/pghoard/pghoard.json --site default

  Basebackup                                      Size  Start time            Metadata
  ----------------------------------------  ----------  --------------------  ------------
  default/basebackup/2016-04-12_0                 8 MB  2016-04-12T07:31:27Z  {'original-file-size': '48060928', 'start-wal-segment': '000000010000000000000012', 'compression-algorithm': 'snappy'}

If we'd want to restore to the latest point in time we could fetch the required basebackup by running::

  pghoard_restore get-basebackup --target-dir /var/lib/pgsql/9.5/data --site default --config /var/lib/pghoard/pghoard.json --restore-to-master

  Basebackup complete.
  You can start PostgreSQL by running pg_ctl -D foo start
  On systemd based systems you can run systemctl start postgresql
  On SYSV Init based systems you can run /etc/init.d/postgresql start

Note that the ``target-dir`` needs to be either an empty or
non-existing directory in which case PGHoard will automatically create
it.

After this we'd proceed to start both the PGHoard server process and the
PostgreSQL server normally by running (on systemd based systems)::

  systemctl start pghoard
  systemctl start postgresql-9.5

Which will make PostgreSQL start recovery process to the latest point
in time. PGHoard must be running before you start up the
PostgreSQL server. To see other possible restoration options please run::

  pghoard_restore --help


Configuration keys
==================

``active`` (default ``true``)

Can be set on a per ``backup_site`` level to ``false`` to disable the taking
of new backups and to stop the deletion of old ones.

``active_backup_mode`` (no default)

Can be either ``pg_receivexlog`` or ``archive_command``. If set to
``pg_receivexlog``, ``pghoard`` will start up a ``pg_receivexlog`` process to be
run against the database server.  If ``archive_command`` is set, we rely on the
user setting the correct ``archive_command`` in ``postgresql.conf``.

``alert_file_dir`` (default ``os.getcwd()``)

Directory in which alert files for replication warning and failover are
created.

``backup_location`` (no default)

Place where ``pghoard`` will create its internal data structures for local state
data and the actual backups.  (if no object storage is used)

``backup_sites`` (default ``{}``)

This object contains names and configurations for the different PostgreSQL
clusters (here called ``sites``) from which to take backups.  Each site's
configuration must list one or more nodes (under the configuration key
``nodes``) from which the backups are taken.  A node can be described as an
object of libpq key: value connection info pairs or libpq connection string
or a ``postgres://`` connection uri.

``basebackup_count`` (default ``1``)

How many basebackups should be kept around for restoration purposes.  The
more there are the more diskspace will be used.

``basebackup_interval_hours`` (no default)

How often to take a new basebackup of a cluster.  The shorter the interval,
the faster your recovery will be, but the more CPU/IO usage is required from
the servers it takes the basebackup from.  If omitted or set to a null value
basebackups are not automatically taken at all.

``encryption_key_id`` (no default)

Specifies the encryption key used when storing encrypted backups. If this
configuration directive is specified, you must also define the public key
for storing as well as private key for retrieving stored backups. These
keys are specified with ``encryption_keys`` dictionary.

``encryption_keys`` (no default)

This key is a mapping from key id to keys. Keys in turn are mapping from
``public`` and ``private`` to PEM encoded RSA public and private keys
respectively. Public key needs to be specified for storing backups. Private
key needs to be in place for restoring encrypted backups.

You can use ``pghoard_create_keys`` to generate and output encryption keys
in the ``pghoard`` configuration format.

``http_address`` (default ``"127.0.0.1"``)

Address to bind the PGHoard HTTP server to.  Set to an empty string to
listen to all available addresses.

``http_port`` (default ``16000``)

HTTP webserver port. Used for the archive command and for fetching of
basebackups/WAL's when restoring if not using an object store.

``json_state_file_path`` (default ``"/tmp/pghoard_state.json"``)

Location of a JSON state file which describes the state of the ``pghoard``
process.

``log_level`` (default ``"INFO"``)

Determines log level of ``pghoard``.

``maintenance_mode_file`` (default ``"/tmp/pghoard_maintenance_mode_file"``)

If a file exists in this location, no new backup actions will be started.

``stream_compression`` (default ``false``)

If you set this to true ``pghoard`` will use an optimized way of taking
a basebackup directly in a compressed and encrypted form saving
diskspace. The downside is that you can't create have any tablespaces
other than the default ones and you cannot take other basebackups at
the same time as ``pghoard`` is taking its own. As guidance few
installations use extra tablespaces and if you already use ``pghoard`` to
take basebackups, you will not need to take other basebackups yourself
meaning this option is probably safe to use but you need to opt in
explicitly in order to benefit from it.

``upload_retries_warning_limit`` (default ``3``)

After this many failed upload attempts for a single file, create an
alert file.

``object_storage`` (no default)

Configured in ``backup_sites`` under a specific site.  If set, it must be an
object describing a remote object storage.  The object must contain a key
``storage_type`` describing the type of the store, other keys and values are
specific to the storage type.

The following object storage types are supported:

* ``google`` for Google Cloud Storage, required configuration keys:

 * ``project_id`` containing the Google Storage project identifier
 * ``bucket_name`` bucket where you want to store the files
 * ``credential_file`` for the path to the Google JSON credential file

* ``s3`` for Amazon Web Services S3, required configuration keys:

 * ``aws_access_key_id`` for the AWS access key id
 * ``aws_secret_access_key`` for the AWS secret access key
 * ``region`` S3 region of the bucket
 * ``bucket_name`` name of the S3 bucket

* ``s3`` for other S3 compatible services such as Ceph, required
  configuration keys:

 * ``aws_access_key_id`` for the AWS access key id
 * ``aws_secret_access_key`` for the AWS secret access key
 * ``bucket_name`` name of the S3 bucket
 * ``host`` for overriding host for non AWS-S3 implementations
 * ``port`` for overriding port for non AWS-S3 implementations
 * ``is_secure`` for overriding the requirement for https for non AWS-S3
   implementations

* ``azure`` for Microsoft Azure Storage, required configuration keys:

 * ``account_name`` for the name of the Azure Storage account
 * ``account_key`` for the secret key of the Azure Storage account
 * ``container_name`` for the name of Azure Storage container used to store
   objects

* ``swift`` for OpenStack Swift, required configuration keys:

 * ``user`` for the Swift user ('subuser' in Ceph RadosGW)
 * ``key"`` for the Swift secret_key
 * ``auth_url`` for Swift authentication URL
 * ``container_name`` name of the data container

 * Optional configuration keys fro Swift:

  * ``auth_version`` - defaults to ``2.0`` for keystone, use ``1.0`` with
    Ceph Rados GW.
  * ``segment_size`` - defaults to ``1024**3`` (1 gigabyte).  Objects larger
    than this will be split into multiple segments on upload.  Many Swift
    installations require large files (usually 5 gigabytes) to be segmented.
  * ``tenant_name``

``pg_basebackup_path`` (default ``"/usr/bin/pg_basebackup"``)

Determines the path where to find the correct ``pg_basebackup`` binary.

``pg_receivexlog_path`` (default ``"/usr/bin/pg_receivexlog"``)

Determines the path where to find the correct ``pg_receivexlog`` binary.

``pg_xlog_directory`` (default ``"/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_xlog"``)

This is used when ``pghoard_postgres_command`` is used as PostgreSQL's
``archive_command`` or ``restore_command``.  It should be set to the
absolute path to the PostgreSQL ``pg_xlog`` directory.  Note that
``pghoard`` will need to be able to read and write files from the directory
in order to back them up or to recover them.

``restore_prefetch`` (default ``min(compression.thread_count,
transfer.thread_count) - 1``)

Number of files to prefetch when performing archive recovery.  The default
is the lower of Compression or Transfer Agent threads minus one to perform
all operations in parallel when a single backup site is used.

``syslog`` (default ``false``)

Determines whether syslog logging should be turned on or not.

``syslog_address`` (default ``"/dev/log"``)

Determines syslog address to use in logging (requires syslog to be true as
well)

``syslog_facility`` (default ``"local2"``)

Determines syslog log facility. (requires syslog to be true as well)

* ``compression`` WAL/basebackup compression parameters

 * ``algorithm`` default ``"snappy"`` if available, otherwise ``"lzma"``
 * ``thread_count`` (default ``5``) number of parallel compression threads

* ``transfer`` WAL/basebackup transfer parameters

 * ``thread_count`` (default ``5``) number of parallel uploads/downloads
