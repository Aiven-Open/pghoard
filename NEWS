pghoard X.X.X (XXXX-XX-XX)
==========================

* `local-tar` backups are now split to roughly 2 gigabyte chunks of
  plain-text files.  New basebackups now benefit from some parallelization,
  as up to 5 chunks may be uploaded in parallel while new backup chunks are
  being created.
* `pghoard_restore` can now download and extract chunked basebackups using
  all CPU cores of the machine assuming that the parallel download mechanism
  can deliver it chunks fast enough
* Alternative `pghoard_postgres_command` implementation in Go for faster
  startup times.  The time that the Python implementation takes to start
  limits WAL restore throughput quite a bit

pghoard 1.5.0 (2017-06-07)
==========================

* New tool, `pghoard_archive_cleanup` to clean up any orphan WAL segments
  from the object store
* Basebackup `end-time` and `end-wal-segment` are now stored in metadata and
  used for PITR when `local-tar` basebackups are used
* Azure object storage updated to work with the latest python-azure-storage
  module and promoted to production ready status
* Google object storage driver now retries operations on failure to work
  around transient connection reset and backend failure issues
* Google object storage compatibility with Google oauth2client version 1.5+
* S3 driver now supports server side encryption
* Swift driver now supports the region_name configuration option
* Support for `local-tar` backups of a replica on PostgreSQL 9.6 and newer
  using the new non-exclusive backup mechanism.  Previous PostgreSQL
  versions require the pgespresso extension to take backups of replicas
  using the `local-tar` method, the pg_basebackup utilizing (default)
  methods have always supported backups of replicas
* When `local-tar` basebackups are used in exclusive mode (PG <= 9.5 without
  pgespresso) any conflicting exclusive basebackup is automatically cancelled
  to allow PGHoard to take its own basebackup.  This is sometimes required if
  a previous PGHoard process has been killed while it was taking a backup
* Support pghoard_restore --recovery-target-action with 9.3 and 9.4
* Creating a `maintenance_mode_file` as documented in README now stops
  automatic basebackups from being created
* Changed the default directory for `maintenance_mode_file` and
  `json_state_file_path` from /tmp to /var/lib/pghoard
* Autotune compression.thread_count and transfer_agent.thread_count defaults
  to be max(cpu_count, 5) instead of a default of 5 as before
* Support for Python 3.6
* Miscellaneous bug fixes

pghoard 1.4.0 (2016-07-22)
==========================

* Add ability to get state file from webserver using GET /status
* Support for Telegraf and DataDog statsd
* Basebackup restoration now shows download progress
* New `basebackup_mode` option: `local-tar` to collect files directly from
  `$PGDATA` instead of running pg_basebackup.  The `local-tar` mode allows
  backing up user tablespaces
* New site-specific configuration option ``pg_data_directory`` is required
  to use the new ``local-tar`` mode, but it's also recommended in other
  configurations as the ``pg_xlog_directory`` option is now deprecated and
  will be removed in a future release
* New site-specific configuration option ``pg_bin_directory`` replaces the
  previous global ``pg_basebackup_path`` and ``pg_receivexlog_path``
  configuration options.  This allows handling multiple versions in a single
  pghoard configuration and simplifies configuration as a single option is
  needed instead of two.  Also, if a pg_data_directory exists the binary
  directory is automatically looked up from various well-known paths,
  removing the requirement of setting this option when using PGDG Debian,
  RHEL or Fedora packages.
* Basebackup handling was refactored to more cleanly handle the different
  operation modes: pipe data directly from pg_basebackup's stdout to PGHoard
  compression or collect the temporary tar files first that pg_basebackup
  writes itself.  This introduced a new configuration option per site:
  `basebackup_mode` which supersedes the old `stream_compression` config
  option
* Revamped file transformation (encryption, compression) interfaces
* Make sure object storage modules are importable when reading configuration
  instead of only checking it when they are used
* Improved PostgreSQL 9.2, 9.6 beta and Python 3.3 compatibility
* Experimental support for new mode walreceiver which uses the PostgreSQL
  replication protocol. Much faster and less resource consuming WAL replication
  than when using active_backup_mode: pg_receivexlog.

pghoard 1.3.0 (2016-05-30)
==========================

* Support for PostgreSQL 9.6 (beta 1)
* Always use strings as metadata keys and values in object storage, fixing
  recent issues with Google Cloud Storage which started throwing a "Backend
  Error" when an integer value was used as well as fixing old WAL cleanup.
* Make LZMA compression level configurable
* Fix unprocessed file handling in receivexlog mode after restart
* Miscellaneous bug fixes

pghoard 1.2.0 (2016-04-28)
==========================

* Support for PostgreSQL 9.2
* Support for Python 3.3
* Various commands no longer require site if a config file with a single
  site is used.  Configuration handling was refactored and much improved
* S3 multipart uploads for greater network error resiliency
* Creating new basebackups by timer can be disabled entirely for a site by
  removing the basebackup_interval_hours option or setting it to a null
  value
* Ignore requests to archive backup labels, they are not used by PGHoard
* Emit a warning when running under systemd without python-systemd installed
* Test and logging improvements, including support for proper use of syslog
* Miscellaneous bug fixes

pghoard 1.1.0 (2016-04-05)
==========================

* Consider last basebackup's start time instead of completion time for
  scheduling the next basebackup
* pghoard_create_keys can now update an existing configuration file
* Support for OpenStack Swift object storage
* More generic object storage configuration.  All configuration keys for
  object stores are passed as-is to the implementation.  This also meant
  that some defaults were dropped: bucket_name and container_name must be
  manually set, they no longer default to `pghoard`.
* New test cases to validate object storage interfaces - the tests revealed
  a couple of minor issues which have been fixed in this release
* ``pghoard`` can now be built from a checkout of a tag, namely generation
  version.py no longer requires a .git directory
* Documentation and build process improvements

pghoard 1.0.0 (2016-03-16)
==========================

* Support for PostgreSQL 9.3 - 9.5
* Support compressing basebackups on the fly
* Add archive_sync command to sync archive / check archive integrity
* Support different recovery_targets
* Support encryption and integrity protection of the backup files
* Snappy compression support
* Better unittests (also with an actual PostgreSQL)
* Require Python3.4 or newer
* Support prefetching files during restore
* Bug fixes

pghoard 0.9.0 (2015-06-19)
============================

* Initial release
